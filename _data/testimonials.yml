    I went away from our session feeling so confident, not just in how my make up looked, my newly practiced skills in applying it, and the quality of the products you recommended, but maybe most importantly, how to care for my skin as well. Thank you so much for offering these sessions! I'm so glad I came, I'm so excited about everything we worked on together.

    My tutorial with Marianne was fantastic! She's not only talented, she's fun and engaging, and listens and adapts her recommendations and techniques to what you're looking for. She's a patient and supportive teacher and I left looking like myself; just a more polished and youthful version!

    Marianne is a brilliant make-up artist. She made me feel and look beautiful on my wedding day. Her calm, warm and authentic attitude and engaging personality helped me and my maid of honour feel comfortable throughout. I recommend her artistry for your special day.

    Marianne was so amazing to work with! She makes you feel comfortable right from the start, and made my wedding vision come to life. She is able to make you feel beautiful without putting on too much makeup, and is able to work with your features to make it feel bridal. Marianne got sick before my wedding and we appreciated her transparency, ability to problem solve, and her quickness to come up with effective solutions if she could not attend. Ultimately we decided an under the weather Marianne was better than no Marianne at all and she did awesome, even when not feeling 100%. Thanks so much, can't wait to work together in the future!

    I had the absolute pleasure of having Marianne as my makeup artist on my wedding day, and I can't recommend her enough. From the moment she arrived, she brought such a calming and comforting presence, which was exactly what I needed on a busy, emotional morning. I don't usually wear much makeup, but she made me feel so comfortable and understood exactly what I was hoping for. The end result was natural, beautiful, and still felt very "me." I was so impressed with her skill and how effortless she made the whole experience. Marianne truly went above and beyond, and I'm so grateful she was part of my day.
  highlight: Calm and comforting
