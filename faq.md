    <h2 class="faq-section-title">The Bridal Process & What to Expect</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>What does the bridal makeup process look like from start to finish?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>It starts with a conversation. Once you reach out, we'll chat about your wedding vision, your comfort level with makeup, and any details that matter to you. Once you secure your booking, you'll be able to book a trial appointment so we can collaborate on your look well before the big day. On your wedding morning, I'll arrive with everything prepped and ready so the experience feels calm, personal, and enjoyable... not rushed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>Do I need a bridal makeup trial before my wedding?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I strongly recommend it. A trial is where we get to know each other and build your look together — step by step — so there are no surprises on the day. It's a relaxed appointment where we can experiment, refine, and make sure you feel completely confident. Trials are booked separately from your wedding day service.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>What style of makeup do you specialize in?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I specialize in what I'd describe as a hybrid between natural makeup and soft glam — makeup that enhances your features rather than masking them. Think luminous skin, defined eyes, and a polished finish that still looks and feels like you. My goal is always for you to look in the mirror and see the most radiant version of yourself, not someone you don't recognize.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>I don't usually wear much makeup — will I feel comfortable?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Absolutely. Many of my brides don't wear makeup day-to-day, and that's completely fine. My approach is collaborative — I'll work within your comfort zone and build the look gradually, checking in with you at each step. Your trial is the perfect opportunity for us to find the balance that feels right for you. You should feel like yourself, just elevated.</p>

      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>How long does bridal makeup application take?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Bridal makeup typically takes about 1hr to 1.5hrs depending on the look. I build buffer time into every wedding morning timeline so nothing feels rushed. If you have a bridal party, we'll map out a schedule together so everyone is taken care of and ready with time to spare.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>Will my makeup last all day and photograph well?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes — longevity and photography are at the heart of how I work. I use professional, long-wearing products and techniques specifically designed for all-day wear and to look beautiful on camera. From proper skin prep through to setting, every step is designed to ensure your makeup looks as good in your last dance photos as it did walking down the aisle.</p>

        <span>Can you do makeup for my bridesmaids, mum, or other guests?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Of course! I specialize in smaller parties of up to 3 services but if you have more people than that, I may bring an additional artist to ensure everyone is taken care of without any time pressure.</p>

        <span>How far in advance should I book my wedding makeup?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I recommend reaching out as soon as you have your date confirmed — popular dates during peak wedding season (May through October on Vancouver Island) can fill up quickly. Booking 12 months in advance is ideal, but I'm always happy to check availability for shorter timelines.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Pricing varies depending on your needs — whether it's just you or a full bridal party, your location, and whether you'd like a trial. You can find my current pricing on my <a href="/pricing/">pricing page</a>, or feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> and I'll put together a personalized quote based on your wedding details.</p>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The bridal trial is a separate booking from your wedding day service. I keep them separate so you have the flexibility to schedule your trial at a time that works best for you. Full pricing details are on my <a href="/pricing/">pricing page</a>.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Life happens, and I completely understand that plans can change. My cancellation and rescheduling terms are outlined in the contract you'll receive at booking. I try to be as flexible and fair as possible — if your plans shift, just reach out and we'll figure it out together.</p>

        <p>I'm based in Victoria and mainly serve the Greater Victoria area, including Saanich, Sidney, Langford, Sooke, and the surrounding communities.

    <h2 class="faq-section-title">Preparing Your Skin for Your Wedding Day</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>How should I prepare my skin before wedding day makeup?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Great makeup starts with great skin. In the months leading up to your wedding, focus on consistency: a gentle cleanser, a good moisturizer suited to your skin type, and daily SPF. Hydration from the inside matters too — drink plenty of water. If you're thinking about adding new treatments or products to your routine, start early so your skin has time to adjust well before the big day.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>Should I get a facial before my wedding?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>A hydrating facial can be a lovely addition to your pre-wedding prep — but timing matters. I'd recommend scheduling any facials at least two weeks before the wedding, not the week of. This gives your skin time to settle and avoids any potential reactions or sensitivity. Avoid extractions or aggressive treatments close to the day.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
        <span>Should I try new skincare products before my wedding?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I always advise against introducing anything new in the final 4–6 weeks before your wedding. New products can cause unexpected reactions, breakouts, or sensitivity — and that's the last thing you want. Stick with what your skin already knows and loves. If you're looking to upgrade your routine, start at least 3–6 months out.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">

        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Clean and moisturized — that's all you need. Apply your regular moisturizer, but skip any heavy serums, oils, or thick creams that could affect makeup adhesion. I'll take care of the rest with a proper skin prep before we begin. You're in good hands.</p>

      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">

        <div class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Absolutely. With 20 years in the beauty industry and experience working with all skin types, I'm well-equipped to work with sensitive, reactive, or allergy-prone skin. Please let me know about any allergies or concerns in your inquiry form or consultation call.</p>
